# Simulation Aviation Warfare (SAW)

## Mission
To provide a community in which Camaraderie, Cooperation, and Courtesy are hallmarks of those that serve with in it.  Our community endeavors to enable our members to enjoy the exciting world of military aviation simulation, primarily with in IL2 and DCS.

Seeking to be transparent in governance and in leadership, all of our communityâ€™s decisions are either voted upon or discussed openly with the community.  Open communication and the democratic system is at the core of our community. 

## Organization
A central body of administrative officers see to the day in and day out functions of the community.  However, the members themselves make up the core of what SAW is about.  As a member you are entitled to organize events however and whenever you like.  One member may want to run mission with strict realistic communication standards using military like organizational systems, another member may want to run a looser casual event.  

During any planned event each individual member at the time of their event is the Commanding Officer (C.O.).  They may choose a chain of command for their event or not. In this regard a C.O. for one event may server as least in rank in another if the C.O. or pilot so chooses.  This gives some that may have vastly more experience the ability to contribute to the community from the outset. 

The door to our community is open to all.  Our discord, and TeamSpeak communication is free to be used by all without need for membership as long as those that use it follow the code laid out in our charter.

## Membership
To become a member, you have to show base competency with aircraft in either DCS or IL2.  You also agree to be an active part of the democratic process of our community. 

## Pilot Code
- Show Respect and Courtesy to your fellow pilots. No racism, bigotry, or cruelty in text or voice communications.  This includes trolling or spamming.
- Think of others but grow thicker skin.  Not everyone needs to be or is "politically correct".  Seek to be patient with those that have a different view than your own.  The personalities in this hobby are often rough around the edges, and may require adaptation. 
- None of our community resources are to be used for any form of "cheating".  This includes using chat/voice to identify the location of opposing pilots.
- Maintain composure when you are shot down or killed. It happens to us all, and we all have to endeavor to laugh it off and learn from our mistakes. 
- If you are not running an OP don't steam roll communications.  Unless you are the C.O. listen more, speak less.
- Members must respect others organiztaion of events and if conflicts in scheduling arise fairly and maturely to find a resolution.
